# Attac:k!
## Stop Scrolling, Start Playing.

**Attac:k!** is a project whose objective is to help musicians to organize and explore their sample packs.

Those maps sort sounds by similarity and allow musicians to naviguate flowlessly and intuitively in their sample packs. *(for more information please refer to the pitch deck above)*
